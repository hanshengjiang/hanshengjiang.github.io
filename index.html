I am a rising fourth-year PhD student in the Department of <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS)</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~chunlei.liu/">Chunlei Liu</a>. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from Caltech in 2017.
<p class="lead">
I am broadly interested in developing new imaging techniques with custom-built hardware. I would like to develop methods that deviate from standard practice that hopefully push the boundaries of what is possible in dramatic ways. I have and am continuing to work on multiphoton excitation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, one research area that I am currently particularly interested in pursing is that of portable, very low field scanners.

<!--
Growing up in San Diego, a hub for biotech work in California, Victor was exposed to biology research early on in high school. In his undergraduate years at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Victor was lured by the prospect of controlling nature and studied electrical engineering and computer science. During his summers in college, he worked on optical metamaterials research in Professor Harry Atwater’s lab at Caltech, power electronics device modeling at the Mitsubishi Advanced Technology R&D Center in Amagasaki, Japan, and deep learning accelerator development at the IBM Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. Thinking that he would continue to work on digital circuits, he entered the PhD program at the University of California, Berkeley in 2017. In his first semester, however, he took a class taught by Professor Chunlei Liu entitled “Advanced Brain Imaging Methods.” After being amazed by how MRI can noninvasively image at depth with so many possible contrast mechanisms and no ionizing radiation, he joined Chunlei’s lab. In the future, Victor hopes that his imaging methods will enable us to better understand what goes on within ourselves.
