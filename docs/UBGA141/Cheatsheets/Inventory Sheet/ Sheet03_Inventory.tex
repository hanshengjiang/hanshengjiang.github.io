% This is the LaTeX template file for lecture notes for CS294-8,
% Computational Biology for Computer Scientists.  When preparing 
% LaTeX notes for this class, please use this template.
%
% To familiarize yourself with this template, the body contains
% some examples of its use.  Look them over.  Then you can
% run LaTeX on this file.  After you have LaTeXed this file then
% you can look over the result either by printing it out with
% dvips or using xdvi.
%
% This template is based on the template for Prof. Sinclair's CS 270.

\item Comparison of four inventory models

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{inventory_models}
\end{figure}

\item Computation of key quantities

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
	\[
	\text{EOQ} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times S \times D}{h}},
	\]
	where $D$ and $h$ are respectively the demand and holding cost within the same amount of time, and $S$ is the fixed setup cost incurred per order.
	\item Continuous review model (Q,R)
	\[
	Q =  \sqrt{\frac{2 S D}{h}}, R = \mu_{LT} + z \sigma_{LT},
	\]
	where $\mu_{LT}$ is the mean demand during lead time $LT$, $\sigma_{LT}$ is the demand standard deviation during lead time $LT$, and $z$ represents the z score based on the service level.
	\item Periodic review model (P,T)
	\[
	P = \sqrt{ \frac{2S}{Dh}}, T = \mu_{P+LT} + z \sigma_{P+LT},
	\]
	where $S,D,h$ are defined the same as in the (Q,R) model,  $\mu_{P+LT}$ is the mean demand during $P+LT$, $\sigma_{P+LT}$ is the demand standard deviation during lead time $P+LT$, , and $z$ represents the z score based on the service level.
	\item Newsvendor
	The order quantity $Q^*$ satisfies
	\[
	\text{Prob} (D \leq Q^*) = 	\text{Critical ratio} = \frac{G}{G+L},
	\]
	where $G$ is gain if stock additional unit and sell it, and $L$ is loss if stock additional unit and donâ€™t sell it.
