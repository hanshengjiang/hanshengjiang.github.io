%
% To familiarize yourself with this template, the body contains

\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Newsvendor
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  	The order quantity $Q^*$ satisfies
		\[
		\text{Prob} (D \leq Q^*) = 	\text{Critical ratio} = \frac{G}{G+L},
		\]
		where $G$ is gain if stock additional unit and sell it, and $L$ is loss if stock additional unit and donâ€™t sell it.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Supply Chain
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $Q$ denote the order quantity, and let $D$ denote the random demand with expectation/mean $\mu$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Leftover inventory = $\max\{Q-D, 0\}$ = $Q- \min\{Q,D\}$
		\item Lost sales  = $\max\{D-Q, 0\}$ =  $D- \min\{Q,D\}$
		\item Sales  = $\min\{Q,D\}$
	\end{itemize}
	
	The following two fundamental equalities hold.
	\[
	\text{Expected lost sales + Expected sales } = \text{Expected demand } \mu
	\]
	\[
	\text{Expected sales + Expected leftover inventory} = \text{Expected order quantity } Q.
	\]
	
	\item Read the ``Standard Normal Inventory/Loss Table''
	\[
	\text{Expected leftover inventory }= \text{Demand standard deviation } \sigma \times  I(z)
	\]
	where $z$ is the ratio of $(Q-\mu)/\sigma$, and $I()$ is the standard normal inventory function read from the table. 
	
	\[
	\text{Expected lost sales}= \text{Demand standard deviation } \sigma \times  L(z)
	\]
	where $z$ is the ratio of $(Q-\mu)/\sigma$, and $L()$ is the standard normal inventory function read from the table. 
	
	

	
	\item Expected profit of Newsvendor is
	\[
	G \times \text{Expected sales}  - L \times \text{Expected leftover inventory}
	\]
	where gain $G$ and loss $L$ need to be interpreted based on contexts by taking into consideration costs, prices, salvage value, and shipping costs whenever needed. Remember that alternatively, $G$ can be viewed as underage cost and $L$ can be viewed as overage cost.
	
	\item Optimal Buy-back price  is equal to 
	\[
	\text{Shipping cost + Price } -    \frac{(\text{Price - Wholesale price})\times(\text{Price - Salvage value})}{\text{Price - Cost}},
	\]
	where `Price' refers to retailing price, and `Cost' refers to production cost. 
	
\end{enumerate}

\item Queue
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Coefficients of variation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Coefficients of variation for the arrival process $CV_a $= Std of interarrival time / average interarrival time 
		\item Coefficients of variation for the processing $CV_p $=  Std of processing time / average processing time
	\end{itemize}
	\item  Implied utilization = Demand / Capacity = $p/(a\times m)$. Utilization = Flow rate/ Capacity. When Implied utilization $<$ 1, Demand = Flow rate, then utilization = implied utilization.
	
	\item Time in queue / Waiting time
	\[
	\text{Time in queue} = \left(\frac{p}{m} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Utilization}^{\sqrt{2m+2}- 1}}{\text{1-Utilization}}\right) \times \left( \frac{CV_a^2 +CV_p^2}{2} \right)
	\]
	where $a$ is average interarrival time. $p$ is the average processing time, and $m$ is the number of servers.
	
	Time in system = time in queue + processing time ($p$)
	
	\item Number of customers = Time in system * flow rate  ($\frac{1}{a}$)
	
\end{enumerate}
