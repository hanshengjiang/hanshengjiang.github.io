       We study an intertemporal pricing problem in the presence of reference effects and consumer heterogeneity. Our research question is how to estimate heterogeneous consumer reference effects from data and how to efficiently compute the optimal pricing policy. It is well established in the literature and widely observed in practice that reference effects have impacts on consumers' purchase decisions. Understanding reference effects is of great importantance for designing pricing policies in modern retailing. Our work contributes to this area by demonstrating the importance of incorporating consumer heterogeneity under arbitrary distributions. We propose a demand model that allows arbitrary joint distributions of valuations, responsiveness to prices, and responsiveness to reference prices among consumers. To learn consumer heterogeneity from transaction data, we use a nonparametric estimation method. We formulate the pricing optimization as an infinite horizon dynamic programming problem and solve it by proposing a modified policy iteration algorithm. We investigate the structure of optimal pricing policies and prove the sub-optimality of constant pricing policies even when all consumers are loss-averse according to the classical definition. We further illustrate the complex pricing dynamics in a market of heterogeneous consumers. Our numerical studies show that our estimation and optimization framework improves the expected revenue of retailers via accounting for heterogeneity. We validate our model using real data from JD.com, a large E-commerce retailer, and find empirical evidence of consumer heterogeneity. In practice, ignoring consumer heterogeneity may lead to a significant loss of revenue. Furthermore, heterogeneous reference effects offer a strong motive for promotion and price fluctuations.

       Mixture of regression models are useful for regression analysis in heterogeneous populations where a single regression model may not be appropriate for the entire population. We study the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) for fitting these models. The NPMLE is based on convex optimization and does not require prior specification of the number of mixture components. We establish existence of the NPMLE and prove finite-sample parametric (up to logarithmic multiplicative factors) Hellinger error bounds for the predicted density functions. We also provide an effective procedure for computing the NPMLE without ad-hoc discretization and prove a theoretical convergence rate under certain assumptions. Numerical experiments on simulated data for both discrete and non-discrete mixing distributions demonstrate the remarkable performance of our approach. We also illustrate the approach on two real data sets.

       We consider the vehicle repositioning problem for a vehicle sharing network with a fixed number of vehicles distributed across multiple locations. The vehicle sharing service is on-demand and one-way, which means that customers can pick up one vehicle from any location without prior reservation and drop off the vehicle to any location in network after the usage. Due to uncertainty in both customer arriving and vehicle returning, the service provider needs to periodically reposition the vehicles to match the supply with the demand while minimizing the total costs of repositioning labor and lost sales. The repositioning problem is critical in successful management of on-demand one-way vehicle sharing services, and it is challenging both analytically and computationally. The optimal repositioning policy under a general $n$-location network is inaccessible without knowing the optimal value function. Existing literature on computing repositioning policies assumes that the demand distribution is either known or can be simulated effectively from samples collected beforehand. In contrast, we develop an online learning method to dynamically reposition vehicles without knowing the demand distribution in advance. We study the performance of our algorithm by comparing it with the best base-stock policy. The best base-stock policy is a generalization of the popular inventory control policy to the vehicle repositioning problem. We prove that the $T$-period aggregate regret of our algorithm is bounded by $O(T^{\frac{n}{ n+1}}(n\log T)^{\frac{1}{ n+1}})$. For the special case of two locations, the optimal repositioning policy has an explicit structure known as a ``two-threshold'' policy. We further show that our online learning algorithm can be applied to learn the optimal ``two-threshold'' policy online and prove a regret bound of $O(T^{3/4} (\log T)^{1/4})$ when compared to the optimal repositioning policy. Numerical experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
